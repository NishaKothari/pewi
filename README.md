PE/WI - People in Ecosystems / Watershed Integration
=======
We are accepting [pull requests](https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests)!

PE/WI is a simple web-based educational game designed to assist people in multidimensional land-use decision-making. Players iteratively manipulate land cover annually for three years in a virtual 6000 acre watershed to design land use that meets their perceptions and goals for a well-functioning agricultural landscape. The model computes a variety of outputs, including nutrient pollution, stream sediment delivery, level of biodiversity, and agricultural production, which assist them in landscape design.

A detailed project page can be found [here](http://www.nrem.iastate.edu/landscape/content/PEWI).

#Collaboration
PEWI uses the Git Flow method of code collaboration which means that the `development` branch is reserved for active development. All pull requests should be made against the `development` branch! The `master` branch is reserved for 'stable' releases and contains merges from `development`. Github provides extensive [documentation](https://help.github.com/categories/collaborating/) that explains how to collaborate, and there is also a step-by-step [guide](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/) on how to operate in the Git Flow.
